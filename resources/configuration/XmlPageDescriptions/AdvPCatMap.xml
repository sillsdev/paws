		<instruction>You need to make sure the adverbs in your lexicon will be mapped to the syntactic category <category>Adv</category>.  Choose one of the following options, depending on your situation:
<ul>
				<li>If you already have adverbs marked with the category <category>Adv</category> in your lexicon, nothing
  more needs to be done.</li>
				<li>If adverbs are mixed in with another category in the lexicon, you either need to give them the category <category>Adv</category> in your morphological parser, or add the feature <feature>makeAdv</feature> to each appropriate entry in the lexicon so the category will be changed for the syntax.  (If a particular entry can also be used as another syntactic category, make a separate lexical entry for each use.)</li>
				<li>If you have adverbs marked in your lexicon with a distinct category all their own, but it is different from <category>Adv</category>, enter that category below so PAWS can map your morphological category to <category>Adv</category>. <br/>
