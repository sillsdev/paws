    <introduction id="QMainIntroNotPractical" show="swNotPractical">This section considers the main clause and embedded clause varieties of Yes/No questions and content questions.  We will begin with Yes/No questions.
<br/>
        <br/>
 In English, main clause Yes/No questions are formed by moving an auxiliary verb in front of the subject.  Other languages use a Yes/No question marker or special complementizer instead of the fronted auxiliary.  This is the case in embedded Yes/No questions in English: no auxiliary fronting is allowed but <example>whether</example> or <example>if</example> fills the complementizer position.<br/>
        <br/>
As discussed in <section number="10">Complement Clauses</section>, X-bar theory takes the complementizer to be the head of the phrase, so a CP sits on top of the IP for questions even in main clauses.  Sample trees for main clause and embedded Yes/No questions in English are shown here:

        <help href="Help/Cbgbtext.doc#CPYesNoQuestions">Click here for more information about the CP phrase structure of Yes/No questions.</help>
       <br/><br/>Since a language may act differently  in Yes/No questions in the main clause versus subordinate clauses, each type will be discussed in turn.
