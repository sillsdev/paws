	<title level="2">Nominal Phrases - Noun Compounds, Complements and Gerunds</title>
	<introduction>Many languages are like English, in that they have noun modifiers. Normally, we simply think that all nouns can also be used as adjectives, but a closer look reveals that true adjectives come before the noun modifier, as in <example>large, round [syrup bottle]</example> but not <example>*round, syrup large bottle</example>.  Therefore, we will treat noun modifiers as compound nouns which are written as independent words.<br/>
		<br/>In the English examples above, <example>bottle</example> is clearly the head noun rather than <example>syrup</example>, because <example>syrup</example> is restricting the type of <example>bottle</example>, not the other way around.  In all compound nouns and noun modifier constructions in English, the head is the right-most noun in the series.
	<br/><br/>
	In looking for examples of compounds, consider body parts, such as <example>eye lash</example>, kinship terms, such as <example>great grandmother</example>, and foods, such as <example>blackberry pie</example>, as well as the material something was made from, such as <example>brick house</example>.</introduction>

	   <introduction>Now consider prepositional or postpositional phrase (PP) modifiers (or complements), such as in <example>the large, round bottle [of syrup]</example> and <example>the boyâ€™s letter [to that girl]</example>.  Not all languages allow this type of noun modifier or complement, but may express the same meaning in a relative clause.
	   </introduction>
	   <br/>
	   <br/>
	   <prompt>Key your examples of prepositional phrases or postpositional phrases modifying nouns (without the brackets), if allowed in your language.  Do not include possessor phrases, since those were already covered in <section number="5.4">Nominal Phrases - Possessors</section>.  If your language does not use prepositional or postpositional phrases to express these kinds of modifiers, key examples of how your language would express similar nominal phrases.</prompt>

	<introduction>Another case which may look like a noun and a complement may actually be a <technicalTermRef term="ttGerund"/> or gerund phrase.  This whole phrase occupies a normal argument position, such as subject, object, indirect object or the object of a preposition.  Some English examples in full sentences with the gerund phrase bracketed include:
</introduction> 
	<EnglishExample>
		<exItem label="6.">[Studying grammar] is challenging.</exItem>
		<exItem label="7.">He likes [reading Latin poetry].</exItem>
		<exItem label="8.">The receiver showed his worth by [making the catch].</exItem>
	</EnglishExample>
	   <introduction>Such phrases may be possessed or be modified as well, and sometimes only the gerund stands alone as the head of a nominal phrase, as in <example>the badly wounded</example>, <example>the dying</example> and <example>your following</example>. 	   
	      <br/><br/>
	      Some languages may not use a gerund to express similar meanings, but instead use a relative clause.</introduction>
	      <br/>

	   <prompt>Key how your language would express similar kinds of nominal phrase examples (like the bracketed parts of examples 6-8 or the examples in the paragraph following 6-8) here:</prompt>

	   <instruction id="NPCompInstruction" show="swNPPartNPYes">Note that the head of these gerund phrases is categorically a verb, so these are derived nominals.  They will remain verbs in our grammar rules, but need to be distinguished as gerunds so that only the gerund forms of verbs may be used as nouns.
