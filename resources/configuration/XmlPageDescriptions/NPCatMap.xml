<ul>
				<li>If you already have articles marked with the category <category>Art</category> in your lexicon, nothing 
  more needs to be done.</li>
				<li>If articles are mixed in with another category in the lexicon, you either need to give them the category <category>Art</category> in your morphological parser, or add the feature <feature>makeArt</feature> to each appropriate entry in the lexicon so the category will be changed for the syntax.  (If a particular entry can also be used as another syntactic category, make a separate lexical entry for each use.)</li>
