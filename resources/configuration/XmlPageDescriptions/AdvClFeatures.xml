        <introduction>Turning now to adverbial phrases or clauses which express reason or purpose, we find adverbs which stand alone, such as <example>therefore</example> and <example>so</example>, along with those that take various types of complement clauses.  (Examples such as <example>for this reason</example> and <example>on purpose</example> should work based on your answers in <section number="8">Adpositional Phrases</section>.)
           <br/><br/> English examples of reason or purpose adverbs which take clausal complements include the bracketed ones in 7-11:
