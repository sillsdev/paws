<BLOCKQUOTE>Editor's note: This paper was originally presented at SIL's
  General CARLA Conference, 14-15 November 1996, Waxhaw, NC. CARLA, for
  Computer-Assisted Related Language Adaptation, is the application of machine
  translation techniques between languages that are so closely related to each
  other that a literal translation can produce a useful first draft.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H2><A name=abstract>Abstract</A></H2>
<BLOCKQUOTE>This paper documents the current status of a computational
  implementation of English syntax according to the Government and Binding
  Theory. The program used is PC-PATR (see <A
  href="Black1997.htm#McConnel1995">McConnel
  1995</A>), based on the PATR formalism. Both the relevant GB theory and the
  details of the implementation are covered in the text. The appendices include
  sample trees and features and a list of example sentences.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<HR>

<H2><A name=Introduction>1 Introduction</A> </H2>
<P>Some current syntactic theories, such as Lexical Functional Grammar (LFG) (<A
href="Black1997.htm#Bresnan1982">Bresnan
1982</A>), Generalized Phrase Structure Grammar (GPSG) (<A
href="Black1997.htm#GPSG1985">Gazdar,
Klein, Pullum, and Sag 1985</A>) and Head-Driven Phrase Structure Grammar (HPSG)
(<A
href="Black1997.htm#PollardSag1987">Pollard
and Sag 1987</A>, <A
href="Black1997.htm#PollardSag1994">1994</A>),
were developed with computer implementation in mind. They all employ feature
unification as an essential ingredient in their theory. Government and Binding
Theory (GB), on the other hand, was developed totally independently of any
computational concerns. LFG, GPSG, and HPSG have all been modeled to at least
some extent via the PATR formalism (<A
href="Black1997.htm#Shieber1986">Shieber
1986</A>) upon which PC-PATR is founded. To my knowledge, no such implementation
has ever been done for GB. This paper documents the current status of an
implementation of most of GB syntax using the PC-PATR program (<A
href="Black1997.htm#McConnel1995">McConnel
1995</A>).
<P>The purpose of this experimental implementation is two-fold. Initially, it
can be used as a teaching tool for both GB theory and for PC-PATR. The goal is
ultimately to develop a full grammar for Zapotec (and later other languages) to
be used as a syntactic parser and disambiguator for adaptation.
<P>The major challenge that presented itself was how to implement a derivational
or multistratal model within a single stratum system. Since the surface string
is what is available to parse, S-structure is modeled by the grammar. GB's
traces allow the underlying D-structure to be seen within the S-structure, and
constraints between the two levels are captured via feature passing. In each
sub-theory within GB, what part of the theory could be modeled computationally
and how to do so within the current capabilities of PC-PATR had to be
determined.
<P>The paper is divided into five basic sections: Phrase Structure and
Subcategorization, Question Formation, Constructions Involving Movement to
Subject Position, Case and Agreement, and Binding of Reflexives and Equi
Constructions. Within each section, the relevant GB theory is discussed first,
then how it was implemented in PC-PATR is covered.<SUP>[<A
href="Black1997.htm#fn1">1</A>]</SUP>
Since the English grammar is the most complete, it is the focus of the sections
on the PC-PATR implementation, except where the work on another language
provides additional insights. Two appendices show the trees and feature
structures for two complex examples and a list of the sentences that the grammar
accounts for so far.<SUP>[<A
href="Black1997.htm#fn2">2</A>]</SUP>
These sentences include many ungrammatical examples that the grammar must rule
out to be parsing correctly.
<H2><A name=Section2>2 Phrase Structure and Subcategorization</A> </H2>
<P>Both GB and PC-PATR are phrase structure grammars. GB uses a particular form
of phrase structure, called X-Bar Theory, that can be modeled in PC-PATR.
<P>
<H3><A name=Section2.1>2.1 GB: X-Bar Theory</A> </H3>
<P>X-Bar Theory assumes that all phrases (including sentences and clauses) have
the same structure, made up of heads and their projections. The general rules
for this phrase structure are covered in section <A
href="Black1997.htm#Section2.1.2">2.1.2</A>,
after the importance of subcategorization is discussed.
<H4><A name=Section2.1.1>2.1.1 Subcategorization</A> </H4>
<P>A word, such as a noun, verb, adjective or preposition is a lexical category.
In structural terms, they are called <B>heads</B>. A particular head is choosy
about what can combine with it to form a phrase.<SUP>[<A
href="Black1997.htm#fn3">3</A>]</SUP>

<P>Heads and complements are not the only parts of phrases. For example, NPs can
be preceded by words (or sometimes phrases) like: <I>the, no, some, every,
John's, my mother's</I>. APs can be preceded by degree words such as: <I>very,
extremely, rather, quite</I>. PPs can be preceded by <I>just, right</I>. These
items, called <B>specifiers</B>, differ from complements in their position in
the phrase and in the fact that they are not subcategorized for by a particular
head.

<P>Subcategorization is built into X-Bar Theory by the claim that a head
(=X<SUP>0</SUP>) subcategorizes for all and only its sisters. The complements
are always phrases. In addition, heads and their maximal projections share some
features, allowing heads to subcategorize for the heads of their sisters (e.g.
<I>rely</I>). Heads and their specifiers may also share some features.
<P>The only other phrase structure rules allowed are an unordered, recursive
adjunction rule <A

<P>Each of the main verbs not only takes a clausal complement, but chooses which
complementizer the clause must have. This is reminiscent of a verb like
<I>rely</I> which subcategorizes for a PP complement which must have <I>on</I>
as the preposition. Only heads can subcategorize, and only complements or the
head of a complement may be subcategorized for. Therefore, the complementizer
must be the head of the complement clause, which is a complementizer phrase or
CP in X-Bar terms.
<P>To reanalyze the structure of the sentence in X-Bar terms, its head,
complement, and specifier must be determined. Neither of the constituents on the
right side of the rule <A
href="Black1997.htm#ex23">(23ii)</A>
can be the head of a phrase because they are phrases themselves, not lexical
items or words. Evidence of subcategorization is again present in data like <A

<P>When the complementizer is either <I>that</I> or <I>whether</I>, the sentence
that follows is a regular finite sentence. In contrast, when the complementizer
is <I>for</I> <A
href="Black1997.htm#ex28">(28)</A>,
<I>to</I> must be present followed by the bare form of the verb. The
complementizers <I>that</I> and <I>whether</I> subcategorize for a finite
complement, whereas <I>for</I> requires a nonfinite complement.
<P>The marker for nonfinite clauses in English is <I>to</I>. Since the
complementizer <I>for</I> subcategorizes for a nonfinite complement, <I>to</I>
must be the head. Further evidence that <I>to</I> is a head comes from the fact
that <I>to</I> subcategorizes for the bare form of the verb following it.
<P><A
href="Black1997.htm#Chomsky1986">Chomsky
(1986)</A> posits that the tense and agreement features fill the same head
position in finite sentences that <I>to</I> fills in nonfinite sentences. The
category is therefore called Inflection, or Infl or I for short. This means a
sentence is an IP.

<P>In GB, both D-structure and S-structure must conform to the X-Bar phrase
structure rules. The subcategorization requirements are specified to hold at
D-structure.
<P>
<H3><A name=Section2.2>2.2 PC-PATR Implementation</A> </H3>
<P>The PC-PATR implementation models the general rules of X-Bar Theory with
constrained phrase structure rules. Verbal subcategorization requirements are
implemented using a linked list within the subcat feature, as shown in section
<A
href="Black1997.htm#Section2.2.2">2.2.2</A>.

<H4><A name=Section2.2.1>2.2.1 Constrained Phrase Structure Rules</A> </H4>
<P>PC-PATR provides the capability to write general phrase structure rules which
can be constrained via unification constraints. Nothing within PC-PATR limits
the rules to X-Bar Theory; the person writing the rules must discipline himself
to stay within the theory they are modeling.
<P>The phrase structure rules in the English model of GB in PC-PATR are all
specific instances of the X-Bar rules for a particular category. Each rule is
constrained to assure that the rule is only used for the correct lexical items
and to pass certain features between mother and daughter nodes by requiring that
they unify. For example, the rule for the subtree including the nonfinite marker
<I>to</I> is given in <A
href="Black1997.htm#ex31">(31)</A>.
<TABLE cellPadding=2>
  <TBODY>

		&lt;I' type&gt;       = &lt;I type&gt;

		&lt;I' type q&gt;     = -
		&lt;VP agr vform&gt;  = bare
		&lt;VP agr person&gt; = irrelevant</PRE></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
<P>The rule says that the intermediate projection I' splits into the head I and
its complement VP. The first four unification constraints require feature
sharing between the mother I' and a particular one of the daughters. The
<CODE>[subcat]</CODE>, <CODE>[moved]</CODE>, and <CODE>[bind]</CODE> features
(to be explained later) on the VP are passed up to the I' and must unify with
any value for those features present on I' due to another rule. The
<CODE>[type]</CODE> features on I' must unify with those on I. From the next two
constraints, we see that <CODE>[type]</CODE> must include both
<CODE>[fin:-]</CODE> and <CODE>[q:-]</CODE>. The last two constraints restrict
the <CODE>[vform]</CODE> and <CODE>[person]</CODE> features on the VP
appropriately for a nonfinite clause.
<P>The only PC-PATR phrase structure rules that do not directly fit the X-Bar
rules are the rules which introduce subcategorized complements for verbs. Rather
than having all the complements be sisters of V<SUP>0</SUP> under V', the
complements are each sisters of separate instances of V', in a stacked structure
generated by rules such as:<SUP>[<A
href="Black1997.htm#fn7">7</A>]</SUP>

<P>This structure allows the subcategorization requirements to be represented in
the form of a linked list (introduced by <A
href="Black1997.htm#Shieber1986">Shieber
1986:29</A>), as discussed in the next section. It also has the benefit that
fewer phrase structure rules are needed than if each different ordering of
complements required a separate rule. For example, <A
href="Black1997.htm#ex32">(32a)</A> is
called twice for a verb taking two NPs; <A
href="Black1997.htm#ex32">(32a)</A>
then <A
href="Black1997.htm#ex32">(32b)</A> is
used for a verb taking an NP and a PP; and two instances of <A
href="Black1997.htm#ex32">(32b)</A> are
needed for a verb subcategorizing for two PPs. Subcategorized complements are
still distinguished from adjuncts in the PC-PATR implementation, because the
adjuncts are adjoined to VP and must not be subcategorized for.
<P>To illustrate the difference, the GB tree for the VP <I>throw the ball to
Bill</I> is given in <A
href="Black1997.htm#ex33">(33a)</A> and
the PC-PATR stacked structure is shown in <A

<P>
<H4><A name=Section2.2.2>2.2.2 Linked List within [Subcat]</A> </H4>
<P>The subcategorization information for a particular verb is encoded in the
<CODE>\f</CODE> line in the lexicon with an abbreviation for a template. This
template is then expanded in the grammar file into a feature structure. The part
of the feature structure relating to subcategorization is under the feature
<CODE>[subcat]</CODE>, which is broken down into the subfeatures
<CODE>[subj]</CODE> and <CODE>[comp]</CODE> for 'subject' and 'complements',
respectively.<SUP>[<A
href="Black1997.htm#fn8">8</A>]</SUP>
The information within <CODE>[subj]</CODE> and <CODE>[comp]</CODE> has the form
of a linked list. This allows the complements to be matched one at a time with
the proper category in the phrase structure rule as the list is stepped through.

<P>For example, the subcategorization information for a ditransitive verb like
<I>throw</I> would be encoded as shown in <A

<P>Given the subcat feature structure in <A
href="Black1997.htm#ex34">(34)</A> and
the constrained rules in <A
href="Black1997.htm#ex35">(35)</A>, the
PC-PATR program generates the tree <A
href="Black1997.htm#ex33">(33b)</A>
from the bottom up. The verb <I>throw</I> is marked in the lexicon as
ditransitive, so the feature structure in <A
href="Black1997.htm#ex34">(34)</A> is
assigned to it. The verb is placed into the tree by rule <A
href="Black1997.htm#ex35">(35c)</A>.
The unification constraint on this rule passes the subcat information to the
mother node V'. The next two words <I>the ball</I> would be separately parsed
into an NP. The sequence <CODE>V' NP</CODE> matches the right side of rule <A
href="Black1997.htm#ex35">(35a)</A>.
The first unification constraint requires that the features in <CODE>&lt;V'_2
subcat comp first&gt;</CODE>, which are <CODE>[cat:NP]</CODE>, unify with the
features on the NP, as they do. The second unification constraint then serves to
step the list down one, passing only the remaining part of the complement subcat
information up to the mother V'. The third unification constraint percolates the
subject subcat information. Thus, the subcat feature structure for the new V'
is:
<TABLE cellPadding=2>
  <TBODY>
  <TR vAlign=top>
	<TD><A name=ex36>(36)</A></TD>

<P>The process just discussed for the NP complement is repeated for the PP
complement with rule <A
href="Black1997.htm#ex35">(35b)</A>.
After stepping down again through the complement subcat information, the feature
structure passed to the new mother V' allows no more complements, as shown in <A

<P>A similar process restricts the subject subcat information at the appropriate
point in the tree.
<P>At present, only verbal subcategorization is implemented.
<P>
<H2><A name=Section3>3 Question Formation</A> </H2>
<P>Not all surface sentences are the same as their underlying form: Yes/No
questions and content questions are good examples. GB proposes a movement
account which is restricted by certain principles and leaves behind a coindexed
trace. The S-structure after movement is modeled in PC-PATR using null elements
for traces and feature passing to match the subcategorization requirements
appropriately.
<H3><A name=Section3.1>3.1 GB: Movement with Traces</A> </H3>
<P>The relationship between a declarative sentence, such as <A

taken to be a clear case of <B>head movement</B> in GB. <A

show that more is going on in Yes/No questions than simply putting a verb in

<P>Sentences like <A
href="Black1997.htm#ex39">(39)</A> show
that auxiliaries come in a certain order and they subcategorize for the form of
the verb that comes after them.
<TABLE cellPadding=2>
  <TBODY>
  <TR>
	<TD><A name=ex39>(39)</A></TD>
	<TD>Jill could have been playing the piano.</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
<P>In Yes/No questions, this order and form restriction still holds. Then, the
highest auxiliary moves in front of the subject. Two other phenomena show that
the highest auxiliary is important also: VP deletion and the placement of
negation. In <A
href="Black1997.htm#ex40">(40)</A>
negation follows the first auxiliary, and in VP deletion constructions, at least
one auxiliary must remain behind. A coherent account of these two facts yields
that the highest auxiliary must move to I<SUP>0</SUP>.
<TABLE cellPadding=2>
  <TBODY>
  <TR>
	<TD><A name=ex40>(40)</A></TD>
	<TD>Jill couldn't have been playing the piano but Bill could (have
	(been)).</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
<P>Yes/No questions also move the highest auxiliary, but movement to
I<SUP>0</SUP> does not change the word order. Something further is needed for
questions.
<P>GB places two strong restrictions on movement. First, the only possible types
of movement are structure preserving or adjunction. Structure preserving
movement means that the moved element must correctly fit into the tree structure
which existed at D-structure. Heads can only move to head positions and phrases
can only move to specifier positions, since a complement that was not
subcategorized for cannot be added. Adjunction is allowed so the auxiliary could
possibly be adjoined to the IP, but the adjunction rule is recursive, which
incorrectly predicts that more than one auxiliary may be fronted <A
href="Black1997.htm#ex38">(38d)</A>.
The second restriction is the principle of '<A name=NoLossOfInformation>No Loss
of Information</A>,' meaning movement is not allowed to a position which is
already lexically filled. Thus, movement of the highest auxiliary to
I<SUP>0</SUP><SUB>[<TT>+</TT><I>fin</I>]</SUB> is possible since the position is
not filled by a word at D-structure. But where does it go from there to form a
question?
<P>The solution to this puzzle comes from embedded Yes/No questions such as <A
href="Black1997.htm#ex41">(41)</A>.
<TABLE cellPadding=2>
  <TBODY>
  <TR>
	<TD><A name=ex41>(41)</A></TD>
	<TD>I wonder whether Sally has declined the job.</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
<P>Embedded clauses are CPs, so main clauses are also assumed to be CPs. Clauses
containing a question have the feature [<TT>+</TT>q].
<P>The D-structure for <A
href="Black1997.htm#ex38">(38b)</A>,
shown in <A
href="Black1997.htm#ex42">(42a)</A>,
shows that both the I<SUB>[<TT>+</TT><I>fin</I>]</SUB> and the
C<SUB>[<TT>+</TT><I>q</I>]</SUB> heads are available for movement. <A
href="Black1997.htm#ex42">(42b)</A>
shows the S-structure, with <I>has</I> filling the
C<SUB>[<TT>+</TT><I>q</I>]</SUB> position and coindexed traces in both the
I<SUB>[<TT>+</TT><I>fin</I>]</SUB> and V<SUB>[<TT>+</TT><I>aux</I>]</SUB>
positions to show where it moved from.
<P><A name=ex42><!-- --></A><IMG height=520 alt=Tree42
src="Black1997_files/tree42.gif" width=630>
<P>The S-structure in <A
href="Black1997.htm#ex42">(42b)</A>
meets the conditions on movement. Further, this movement provides a natural
account for the fact that no inversion occurs in embedded Yes/No questions <A
href="Black1997.htm#ex41">(41)</A>. In
the embedded clause, <I>whether</I> fills the C<SUB>[<TT>+</TT><I>q</I>]</SUB>
position, so the principle of <A
href="Black1997.htm#NoLossOfInformation">No
Loss of Information</A> blocks the movement. A separate condition is not
necessary.
<P>Content questions provide examples of <IMG height=13
src="Black1997_files/A-bar1.gif" width=11>-movement or movement to a
non-argument position. Argument positions are complements or the subject, so a
non-argument position is a specifier position other than the subject or an
adjoined position.
<P>The question in <A
href="Black1997.htm#ex43">(43)</A> is
generated similarly to the Yes/No question above, with an additional movement
added.

<P>The D-structure in <A

almost identical to <A

except that <I>which job</I> is in the complement position instead of <I>the
job</I> and that NP is marked with the [<TT>+</TT>wh] feature. The S-structure
is generated by moving the NP<SUB>[<TT>+</TT><I>wh</I>]</SUB> to the specifier
of C<SUB>[<TT>+</TT><I>q</I>]</SUB>, along with the movement of the auxiliary to
I<SUB>[<TT>+</TT><I>fin</I>]</SUB> and then to C<SUB>[<TT>+</TT><I>q</I>]</SUB>.

<P><A name=ex44><!-- --></A><IMG height=559 alt=Tree44

<P>The coindexed traces left after movement form a chain between the D-structure
position and the S-structure position of the lexical item. This chain allows
D-structure information such as subcategorization to be retained at S-structure.
It also accounts for proper assignment of semantic roles and case, as will be
discussed in sections <A
href="Black1997.htm#Section4.1">4.1</A>
and <A
href="Black1997.htm#Section5.1">5.1</A>.

<P>
<H3><A name=Section3.2>3.2 PC-PATR Implementation</A> </H3>
<P>The PC-PATR grammar parses the S-structure tree for each sentence. Since
questions involve movement of the auxiliary and a <I>wh</I>-phrase, null
elements are introduced for traces of the movements. The challenge of matching
the subcategorization information with the moved elements is handled by passing
features up or down through the tree.
<H4><A name=Section3.2.1>3.2.1 Null Elements and the [Moved] Features</A> </H4>
<P>PC-PATR allows null elements, but they must be constrained carefully so that
they only show up in the proper places. Therefore, various types of null
elements are used to model the GB traces. V-trace is used for the trace of the
auxiliary, NP-trace is used for the trace of a questioned NP, and PP-trace is
the trace of a questioned PP. The phrase structure rules which define the null
elements are given in <A
href="Black1997.htm#ex45">(45a-c)</A>
and the rules which allow them to be placed into the tree are shown in <A

<P>In content questions, the trace in the D-structure position must be the
correct category as required by the subcategorization frame of the verb, and
this must also match the fronted element. The fact that an NP-trace must only be
used for verbs which subcategorize for an NP can be assured by the unification
constraint in <A

Correctly matching the subcategorization information with the fronted element is
more complex. The constraints <A

assure that the appropriate subcat information is placed into the
<CODE>[moved:A-bar]</CODE><SUP>[<A

<P>Head movement of the auxiliary to C<SUP>0</SUP> provides an additional
challenge. Auxiliaries come in a certain order and each one requires that the
verb following it be in a certain form. This is accounted for by
subcategorization for a particular form of VP. In a question, however, the first
auxiliary is in C<SUP>0</SUP> before the subject, not in I<SUP>0</SUP> or
V<SUP>0</SUP> where local subcategorization can take place. The V-trace is in
the crucial position, but the <CODE>[subcat]</CODE> information is up with the
auxiliary. This <CODE>[subcat]</CODE> information must be passed down to the
position of the V-trace.
<P>For English it turns out to be a simple matter of placing constraints on the
appropriate phrase structure rules to assure that the <CODE>[subcat]</CODE>
information gets passed down to the rule containing the V-trace, so that the
complements can be checked normally. The phrase structure rules and constraints

<P>The desire to maintain the stacked VP structure and the list notation for
<CODE>[subcat]</CODE> discussed in section <A
href="Black1997.htm#Section2.2.2">2.2.2</A>
for QZ introduced an additional complication. Recall that the list is stepped
through as the complements are matched going up the tree from the verb.
Therefore, the <CODE>[subcat]</CODE> information needs to be moved down the tree
from I<SUP>0</SUP> to the position of the V-trace also. The features
<CODE>[down]</CODE> and <CODE>[up]</CODE> were introduced to hold the relevant
<CODE>[subcat]</CODE> information. The information being passed down from the
verb in I<SUP>0</SUP> is in <CODE>[down subcat]</CODE>, while the linked list of
complements is being stepped through in <CODE>[up subcat]</CODE>. The two
feature structures in <CODE>[up subcat]</CODE> and <CODE>[down subcat]</CODE>
are required to unify in the rule introducing V-trace. Sample rules from the QZ
grammar with the relevant constraints are shown in <A

<H2><A name=Section4>4 Constructions Involving Movement to Subject Position</A>
</H2>
<P>Constructions such as passives, unaccusatives, and raising require movement
to the subject position. The constraints on movement discussed in the last
section still hold. In addition, semantic roles and the lack of
subcategorization for a subject are needed.
<H3><A name=Section4.1>4.1 GB: Semantics in the Syntax</A> </H3>
<P>Passive constructions are the most well-known constructions involving
movement to the subject position. The old Transformational Grammar analysis
begins with a transitive deep structure, then creates a passive surface
structure by moving the subject to the <I>by</I>-phrase (or omitting it
completely), moving the object to the subject position, adding the passive
<I>be</I> and changing the verb form appropriately. This movement analysis of
passives captured the generalizations that:

<P>GB does not account for passives in exactly the same way as Transformational
Grammar did, since movement of the object to a previously occupied subject
position would violate the principle of <A
href="Black1997.htm#NoLossOfInformation">No
Loss of Information</A>. The generalizations in <A
href="Black1997.htm#ex51">(51)</A> must
still be accounted for, and GB goes a step further than <A
href="Black1997.htm#ex51">(51c)</A> to
account for the synonymy between the active and passive sentences, as seen in <A
href="Black1997.htm#ex52">(52)</A>.

<P>General semantic roles, such as Agent, Theme, Recipient, Goal, Locative,
etc., can be linked to arguments within the lexical entries to capture this
synonymy. For example, the lexical entry for <I>invite</I> would be:<SUP>[<A
href="Black1997.htm#fn13">13</A>]</SUP>
<PRE>invite, V,     [ _ NP (PP[to]) ]
				 |    |
invite'    &lt;AGT, THEME, GOAL&gt;
</PRE>
<P>where each syntactic complement (called internal arguments) must be linked
one-to-one with a semantic role, and one additional role may be linked to the <A
name=ExternalArgument>external argument</A> (or subject). Lexical entries apply
at D-structure, so not all verbs assign a role to the subject position.<SUP>[<A
href="Black1997.htm#fn14">14</A>]</SUP>

<P>Further assumptions about lexical entries in GB include the desire that the
related forms of a word share a single subcategorization frame and that there
should not be any cross linking of syntactic arguments and semantic roles. For
example - directly relevant to the analysis of Passive - the
<SMALL>THEME</SMALL> should not be assigned to the object in one case and to the
subject in a related entry. This assumption is formalized under the <A
name=UTAH>Uniformity of Theta Assignment Hypothesis</A> (<A
href="Black1997.htm#Baker1988">Baker
1988:46</A>), allowing the broader claim that the <SMALL>THEME</SMALL> role
should always be assigned to the direct object when it is assigned, since that
is its position in normal transitive verbs; the <SMALL>RECIPIENT</SMALL> role is
assigned to the indirect object, etc.
<P>Though the semantic roles are assigned at D-structure through the lexical
entries, further assumptions forbid movement from changing the linking between
syntactic arguments and semantic roles. Therefore, movement out of most
positions is allowed, as we have seen with <I>wh</I>-question formation, but
nothing else can move into that position. The semantic role stays with the
original position rather than moving with the phrase; the semantic role is not
part of the tree but part of the lexical subcategorization that goes with the
D-structure position. Movement into a position linked to a semantic role is not
allowed, since it would cause the moved element to take on that semantic role,
and thus alter the original linking. The coindexed trace provides the link
between the moved element and the position it occupied at D-structure.
Therefore, both semantic role and subcategorization requirements are still
recoverable at S-structure.
<P>Given these assumptions, the GB account of passive must be partly done in the
lexicon and partly by movement. A lexical rule, such as that given in <A
href="Black1997.htm#ex53">(53)</A>, is
used to capture generalizations <A
href="Black1997.htm#ex51">(51a-b)</A>
that passive verbs are related to transitive verbs. In order to account for
alignment of the semantic roles between entries as much as possible and follow
the <A
href="Black1997.htm#UTAH">Uniformity of
Theta Assignment Hypothesis</A>, the object NP remains in position at
D-structure.

<P>Note that no <A

<P><A name=ex54><!-- --></A><IMG height=398 alt=Tree54
src="Black1997_files/tree54.gif" width=533>
<P>Movement of the object to subject position is still needed. This movement can
take place since there is no semantic role linked to the subject position at
D-structure and the position was not lexically filled, so the principle of <A
href="Black1997.htm#NoLossOfInformation">No
Loss of Information</A> is not violated. A coindexed trace is left behind to
maintain the linking of the object to its semantic role. So S-structure looks
like <A
href="Black1997.htm#ex55">(55)</A>:
<P><A name=ex55><!-- --></A><IMG height=414 alt=Tree55
src="Black1997_files/tree55.gif" width=533>
<P>The assumptions made about semantic roles in the lexical entries also
requires us to distinguish between types of intransitive verbs, following the
Unaccusative Hypothesis (<A
href="Black1997.htm#Perlmutter1978">Perlmutter
1978</A>). This means, for example, that while verbs like <I>sleep</I> would
have an <SMALL>AGENT</SMALL> in subject position at D-structure, verbs like
<I>die</I> would have an empty subject position at D-structure with a
<SMALL>THEME</SMALL> object, as shown in the lexical entries. Movement of the
<SMALL>THEME</SMALL> to subject position for the unaccusative verb <I>die</I> is
exactly parallel to the passive movement. <PRE>sleep,  V   [ _ ]            die,  V [ _ NP ]

</PRE>
<P><A name=raising></A>The third type of A-movement (movement to an argument
position) involves raising predicates, such as <I>seem</I> and <I>likely</I>.
These predicates take either a finite or a nonfinite clause complement and do
not assign a semantic role to their own subject position. The lack of a semantic
role assigned to the subject position can be seen when there is a finite clause
complement by the presence of the dummy <I>it</I> <A
href="Black1997.htm#ex56">(56a)</A>. In
the case of a nonfinite clause complement, the subject of the lower clause must
raise to the main clause subject position.

<P>Case Theory (see section <A

provides the motivation for A-movement of the particular NP in passives,
unaccusatives, and raising constructions.
<H3><A name=Section4.2>4.2 PC-PATR Implementation</A> </H3>
<P>The implementation in PC-PATR accounts for the A-movement of the object in
passives and unaccusatives or the lower clause subject in raising constructions
to the main clause subject position in an analogous way to <IMG height=13

covered before moving to the issue of how the changes in the lexical entries are
made.
<H4><A name=Section4.2.1>4.2.1 NP-A-trace and the [Moved: A] Feature</A> </H4>
<P>As far as the phrase structure rules are concerned, A-movement is handled
within PC-PATR in a completely parallel way to the other types of movement
discussed in section <A

The trace of A-movement is distinguished from the <IMG height=13
src="Black1997_files/A-bar1.gif" width=11>-traces by being called
<CODE>NP-A-trace</CODE>. The moved category is stored by the
<CODE>[moved:A]</CODE> feature. The rule responsible for introducing the A-trace
for both passives and unaccusatives is given in <A
href="Black1997.htm#ex57">(57a)</A>,
while the A-trace for raising is introduced by rule <A

<H4><A name=Section4.2.2>4.2.2 Features, Templates and Disjunction</A> </H4>
<P>The PC-PATR implementation differs from GB in that the syntactic form of the
subject is subcategorized for (although it is always either an NP or
<CODE>none</CODE>, which is consistent with GB). Passives, unaccusatives,
raising verbs, and auxiliaries have <CODE>[subcat:[subj:none]]</CODE> within
their feature structure and thus will have a subject only via A-movement.
<P>Putting in the semantic roles seemed to just add the additional feature of
<CODE>[role]</CODE> for each NP, slowing processing without appreciable gain. In
order to use the semantic roles to rule out incorrect parses, we need to specify
which semantic roles a given lexical item or phrase can fill and then unify this
set of roles with the subcategorization requirements of the predicate. Which
phrases can be adjuncts and which must be complements must also be restricted.
These restrictions are not currently implemented; a negation mechanism allowing
specification of what a certain atomic value could not be would be helpful.
<P>The relationship between transitive and passive forms of a particular verb is
handled via disjunctive templates.<SUP>[<A
href="Black1997.htm#fn15">15</A>]</SUP>
For example, a verb like <I>broken</I> would have the feature description
<TT>+en trans/pass</TT>, while the form <I>broke</I> is marked <TT>+past
trans/unacc</TT>. The relevant templates are given in <A
href="Black1997.htm#ex59">(59)</A>.
These templates are then matched with the number of arguments present in the
sentence, etc., to determine whether a correct parse can be given.

<P>As mentioned above, this same implementation of passives and unaccusatives
would be possible without the addition of semantic roles at all for English.
Semantic roles are more interesting and necessary in the implementation of a
syntactic parser for Tatana' in Malaysia, where the case of each nominal is
morphologically marked and the voice of the verb determines the required
ordering and semantic role of the arguments.<SUP>[<A

This template unifies with the <CODE>[trans]</CODE>, <CODE>[intrans]</CODE>, or
<CODE>[ditrans]</CODE> templates on a particular verb to limit the options
available. Note that the basic word order in Tatana' is VSO, but a nominative NP

<P>GB assumes that all NPs must have Case (abstract, not necessarily

Nominative Case is assumed to be assigned to the subject position (the
specifier) by I<SUB>[<TT>+</TT><I>fin</I>]</SUB>. Similarly, Genitive Case is
assigned to the possessor position (the specifier) by the noun. Accusative Case
is assigned by a verb to its NP complements, by a preposition to its complement,
and by the complementizer <I>for</I> to the subject (the specifier) of the

<P>The Case Filter, coupled with Burzio's Generalization (<A
href="Black1997.htm#Burzio1986">Burzio
1986</A>) that predicates that do not assign a semantic role to their <A
href="Black1997.htm#ExternalArgument">external
argument</A> (i.e. do not subcategorize for a subject) cannot assign Case to
their complements, provides the motivation for movement to the subject position
for passives, unaccusatives, and raising constructions. These NPs cannot receive
Case in their D-structure positions, so they must move to a position which
assigns Case: the specifier of I<SUB>[<TT>+</TT><I>fin</I>]</SUB>.
<P>Agreement is also seen to be linked to a particular position or to a
relationship between positions in the tree structure. An
I<SUB>[<TT>+</TT><I>fin</I>]</SUB> agrees with its specifier (the subject), and
it can also subcategorize for a VP with the proper agreement features (including
person, number, and tense).
<H3><A name=Section5.2>5.2 PC-PATR: [Agr] Features and Constraints on NPs</A>
</H3>
<P>The case and agreement features of lexical items, such as
<CODE>[person]</CODE>, <CODE>[number]</CODE>, <CODE>[gender]</CODE>,
<CODE>[case]</CODE>, and <CODE>[vform]</CODE> (for verb form, including tense),
are introduced as subfeatures under <CODE>[agr]</CODE> via templates. Structural
case and structural agreement are then constrained via the phrase structure
rules. For example, the constraint <CODE>&lt;NP agr case&gt;=nominative</CODE>
on the rule which introduces subjects requires that the subject is in nominative
case. Similarly, NP objects are required to have accusative case via a
constraint on the rule <CODE>V' = V'_2 NP</CODE>. Agreement between the subject
and the verb is enforced by percolating the <CODE>[agr]</CODE> features on the
verb up to the I', and then requiring that <CODE>&lt;I' agr&gt;=&lt;NP
agr&gt;</CODE>.
<P>The implementation of case and agreement restrictions becomes more
challenging in dealing with questions. In content questions, the fronted
<I>wh</I>-phrase retains the case it would have had in its D-structure position.
This is enforced at the point of the trace by placing the correct case
information within the <CODE>[moved:A-bar]</CODE> feature matrix, so that this
<CODE>[case]</CODE> feature will have to unify with the <CODE>[case]</CODE> of
the fronted NP. The rules and relevant constraints for subjects and objects

<P>The second problem with questions is dealing with the agreement after
subject-aux inversion. The verb agreement features are not known at the I'
level, as they are in non-questions, since the verb that agrees with the subject
is up in the C position. The <CODE>[agr]</CODE> features of the subject are
therefore passed up to the IP for questions, so that agreement can be enforced
in the rule <CODE>C' = V IP</CODE> via the constraint <CODE>&lt;IP agr&gt;=&lt;V
agr&gt;</CODE>.
<P>Binding constructions are another instance of non-local restrictions on
agreement. The PC-PATR implementation of these restrictions is discussed in
section <A

<H2><A name=Section6>6 Binding of Reflexives and Equi Constructions</A> </H2>
<P>We have now accounted for cases of movement, which GB handles via coindexed
traces, by feature passing in PC-PATR with unification constraints at both ends.
The binding of reflexives and equi constructions can be modeled in a parallel
way, since coindexing is again involved.

<P>In the tree <A
href="Black1997.htm#ex64">(64)</A>
<I>Sally</I> and <I>Max</I> are both in argument positions and they both
c-command the object of <I>disliked</I> and are coindexed with it. Therefore the
object of <I>disliked</I> is A-bound.
<P>The principles of Binding Theory determine whether a pronoun or a reflexive
anaphor or a full NP is correct in a particular position. Informally, Principle
A says that an anaphor can only be used when the position that A-binds it is
local enough (usually within the same finite IP): <I>Max</I> is close enough to
the object of <I>disliked</I> so that the anaphor is correct, but <I>Sally</I>
is too far away to use <I>herself</I>.
<P>Principle B says that a pronoun can only be used if it is not A-bound at all,
or if its A-binder is far enough away. This is why <I>him</I> cannot be used to
refer back to <I>Max</I> but <I>her</I> may refer back to <I>Sally</I>.
<P>Finally, Principle C says that nonpronominals may not be A-bound in the
sentence at all, which rules out repetition of full nominals.
<P>The Principles of Binding Theory thus partition nominal phrases into three
different types. These partitions are characterized by the two features
[±anaphoric] and [±pronominal], where pronouns are
[<TT>-</TT>ana,<TT>+</TT>pro], reflexives and reciprocals are
[<TT>+</TT>ana,<TT>-</TT>pro], and full nominal phrases are neither pronouns nor
anaphors so they are [<TT>-</TT>ana,<TT>-</TT>pro].
<P>The chart in <A
href="Black1997.htm#ex66">(66)</A>
shows these featural distinctions and which Principle of Binding Theory applies.
Empty categories are also included, since GB claims that the chain coindexing
established by movement is equivalent to the coindexing in binding relationships
between overt nominals. Four types of empty categories are recognized,
corresponding to the four possible feature specifications.

<P>Section <A
href="Black1997.htm#Section4">4</A>
covered the trace of A-movement in passive and unaccusative constructions. By
saying that this trace is anaphoric and subject to Principle A, the movement is
restricted to local domains. The trace of <IMG height=13
src="Black1997_files/A-bar1.gif" width=11>-movement in the formation of content
questions was introduced in section <A
href="Black1997.htm#Section3">3</A>.
This trace is subject to Principle C in that it cannot be bound by an element in
an argument position. Since <IMG height=13 src="Black1997_files/A-bar1.gif"
width=11>-movement is movement to a nonargument position, this requirement is
clearly met.
<P>The two new empty categories are not traces, but empty elements in the
lexicon. <I>pro</I> is the empty pronoun allowed in <I>pro</I>-drop languages,
usually because of agreement morphology on the verb to specify the person and
number of the subject, e.g. <I>pro No hablo español</I>. This empty pronoun
shows up in all the same places that an overt pronoun does and is therefore
subject to Principle B.
<P>Finally, <I>PRO</I> is the empty subject in non-finite clauses, sometimes
called controlled <I>PRO</I>. Since it is both anaphoric and pronominal, it is
subject to both Principles A and B of Binding Theory. From this is derived the
fact that <I>PRO</I> must be ungoverned and therefore also not receive
Case.<SUP>[<A
href="Black1997.htm#fn19">19</A>]</SUP>
The only legal position for <I>PRO</I> (and only <I>PRO</I> can be there) is
shown in <A

<P><A name=ex67><!-- --></A><IMG height=363 alt=Tree67

<P>Both <I>pro</I> and <I>PRO</I> have intended reference, even though they are
null. Since they are referential, they bear a semantic role, unlike the <A
href="Black1997.htm#raising">dummy
<I>it</I></A>, which has phonetic content but is nonreferential.
<P>English does not use <I>pro</I>, but we can see the use of <I>PRO</I> in equi
constructions, such as:

<P>Note that both <I>try</I> and <I>want</I> assign the semantic role of

their <A

argument</A>. GB requires a one-to-one mapping between NP positions and semantic
roles, so a null category is necessary in these constructions, namely,
<I>PRO</I>. The tree for <A

<P>
<H3><A name=Section6.2>6.2 PC-PATR: Agreement Features Passed Up in [Bind]</A>
</H3>
<P>Within PC-PATR, only the Principle A requirement that an anaphor agree with
the closest subject is implemented. It is not possible to enforce the
requirements of Principles B and C that a pronoun or full NP does not agree, at
least for third person pronouns. If negation capabilities were added to PC-PATR,
it would be easier to restrict against two first or second person pronouns as
subject and object of the same clause.
<P>In order to account for the reflexive agreement, <CODE>[gender]</CODE>
features are added to all of the nouns, pronouns, and reflexives in the lexicon
under the <CODE>[agr]</CODE> feature discussed in section <A
href="Black1997.htm#Section5.2">5.2</A>.
Reflexives are further distinguished by the feature <TT>[type:[anaphor:+]]</TT>.
All of the phrase structure rules which could introduce an anaphor (including NP
objects of V and objects of prepositions which are themselves objects of either
V or N) are also constrained to place the <CODE>[agr]</CODE> features for the
anaphor into the <CODE>[bind]</CODE> feature matrix, which then acts in a
parallel way to the <CODE>[moved]</CODE> feature matrix. The <CODE>[bind]</CODE>
feature percolates as far as the closest subject position to enforce
coreference, or unification of the <CODE>[agr]</CODE> features.
<P>The most interesting case is the interaction between reflexives and equi
and/or raising constructions. These are the only cases which allow apparent
long-distance binding of anaphors. However, as shown in <A
href="Black1997.htm#ex70">(70)</A>, the
coindexed <I>PRO</I> or A-trace serves as the local A-binder of the reflexive
and then it takes its reference from the upper clause subject.

<P>Equi constructions, such as <A

href="Black1997.htm#ex71">(71)</A>.
This rule is restricted to embedded, nonfinite, non-question clauses <A

The subject subcat list is stepped <A

since <I>PRO</I> counts as the subject of the embedded predicate. The crucial
constraint allowing the apparent long-distance binding of reflexives is <A
href="Black1997.htm#ex71">(71f)</A>,
where the <CODE>[bind]</CODE> features are percolated up to the IP. This is in
contrast to the regular subject rule <A
href="Black1997.htm#ex72">(72)</A>
(used also for the upper clause of an equi or raising construction) where the
<CODE>[bind]</CODE> features must unify with the <CODE>[agr]</CODE> features on
the overt NP subject.

<H2><A name=Section7>7 Conclusion</A> </H2>
<P>This documentation of work in progress is instructive in at least two ways.
First, it presents the development of a parser in PC-PATR that accounts for a
broad range of data, illustrating the capabilities of the PC-PATR program.
Secondly, the attempt to implement GB theory computationally forced precision
into the analysis at several points. For example, the implementation showed that
'coindexing' and feature sharing of nonlocal constituents must be passed through
all local subtrees, including intermediate projections, whereas GB states only
that heads and their maximal projections and heads and their specifiers may
share features.

<P><A name=fn4><STRONG>4</STRONG></A> A * before a word, phrase or sentence
indicates ungrammaticality.
<P><A name=fn5><STRONG>5</STRONG></A> The order of the elements on the right
side of these phrase structure rules is dependent upon the basic word order in
the language.
<P><A name=fn6><STRONG>6</STRONG></A> Both C<SUP>0</SUP> and I<SUP>0</SUP> are
functional heads rather than lexical heads. More recently, additional functional
heads such as Neg<SUP>0</SUP>, Agr<SUP>0</SUP>, and Tense<SUP>0</SUP> have been
proposed to further break down I<SUP>0</SUP> (<A
href="Black1997.htm#Pollock1989">Pollock
1989</A>) and D<SUP>0</SUP> has been proposed as the functional head of the noun
phrase, taking NP as its complement (<A
href="Black1997.htm#Abney1987">Abney
1987</A>, <A
href="Black1997.htm#Stowell1989">Stowell
1989</A>). None of these additional functional heads (or the phrases they
project) are used in the English implementation in PC-PATR, though the
implementation for Quiegolani Zapotec requires a NegP phrase for negation
between CP and IP and uses the DP structure for nominal phrases.
<P><A name=fn7><STRONG>7</STRONG></A> The original PATR-II formalism allowed X
for subcategorized complements (<A
href="Black1997.htm#Shieber1986">Shieber
1986:72</A>). While the X is desirable in capturing the generalization that
whatever follows must be a complement determined by the subcat information, it
turns out to not be feasible in a fuller system due to the differing constraints
needed for the various complements.
<P><A name=fn8><STRONG>8</STRONG></A> GB does not allow subcategorization for
subjects directly, but only for whether or not there is a semantic role assigned
to the subject (see section <A
href="Black1997.htm#Section4.1">4.1</A>).
In the PC-PATR implementation, I allow subcategorization only for an NP subject,
which will have a semantic role, or <CODE>none</CODE>.
<P><A name=fn9><STRONG>9</STRONG></A> In the current form of the grammar, the
highest auxiliary is assumed to begin in the I<SUP>0</SUP> position, rather than
having to move there, so V-trace fills only that position for questions (45d).
For declarative sentences with an auxiliary, the highest auxiliary is placed in
the tree via the rule <CODE>I' = V VP</CODE>, constrained by <TT>&lt;V type
aux&gt;&nbsp;=&nbsp;+</TT>.
<P><A name=fn10><STRONG>10</STRONG></A> The <CODE>[moved]</CODE> feature is a
personal innovation, based upon the slash features of GPSG (<A
href="Black1997.htm#GPSG1985">Gazdar,
Klein, Pullum &amp; Sag 1985</A>). Following GB, <CODE>[moved]</CODE> has three
subordinate features: <CODE>[A-bar]</CODE> (for <I>wh</I>-movement),
<CODE>[head]</CODE> (for head movement such as movement of the auxiliary), and
<CODE>[A]</CODE> (for argument movement to be discussed in section <A
href="Black1997.htm#Section4">4</A>).
<P><A name=fn11><STRONG>11</STRONG></A> Rules <A
href="Black1997.htm#ex48">(48a &amp;
c)</A> are restricted to use in root clause questions only, by other constraints
not shown here. <A
href="Black1997.htm#ex48">(48b)</A> is
a general rule for the position of the subject as the specifier of IP, but the
constraints listed here are included only under the root clause question option
for this rule.
<P><A name=fn12><STRONG>12</STRONG></A> In the GB analysis, the aspect marking
is in I<SUP>0</SUP> at D-structure and the morphological subcategorization
requirements motivate movement of the verb to adjoin to I<SUP>0</SUP> (see <A
href="Black1997.htm#Black1994">Black
1994</A>, <A
href="Black1997.htm#RizziRoberts1989">Rizzi
&amp; Roberts 1989</A>). For PC-PATR, only the position of full words at
S-structure is modeled. Therefore, the verb with its aspect marking is shown in
I<SUP>0</SUP> at S-structure.
<P><A name=fn13><STRONG>13</STRONG></A> The line containing the semantic roles
is introduced by the logical semantic predicate which is indicated by the
syntactic verb form followed by a prime. The lexical entry thus specifies both
syntactic and semantic subcategorization information.
<P><A name=fn14><STRONG>14</STRONG></A> For example, auxiliaries do not:
<TABLE cellPadding=2>
  <TBODY>
  <TR>
	<TD>(i)</TD>
	<TD>Joe may have hit a home run.</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
<P>There is only one <A
href="Black1997.htm#ExternalArgument">external
argument</A> = <I>John</I>. Which verb assigns a semantic role to <I>John</I>?
It is the <SMALL>AGENT</SMALL> of the verb <I>hit</I>; <I>a home run</I> is the
<SMALL>THEME</SMALL> of <I>hit</I>. Auxiliaries do not assign <A
href="Black1997.htm#ExternalArgument">external
arguments</A>: there is nothing anyone did or experienced to <I>may</I>. Instead
they simply select a VP complement that is a type of <SMALL>EVENT</SMALL> or
<SMALL>STATE</SMALL>.
<P><A name=fn15><STRONG>15</STRONG></A> The PC-PATR documentation includes
discussion of a Lexical Rule. Unfortunately, the GB lexical rule assumes
different output conditions than PC-PATR does, so I could not use that mechanism
for handling passives in GB.
<P><A name=fn16><STRONG>16</STRONG></A> The information on Tatana' was obtained
from John Dillon at the Computational Linguistics workshop at the 1994 session
of the Summer Institute of Linguistics held at the University of North Dakota.
<P><A name=fn17><STRONG>17</STRONG></A> These positions which receive Case are
the positions that the particular heads <I>govern</I>.
<P><A name=fn18><STRONG>18</STRONG></A> An area where agreement is particularly
tricky is in coordination constructions. The current grammar restricts
coordinate constructions to third person, plural agreement. Much more would need
to be added to account for the full distribution of agreement patterns in
coordinate constructions.
<P><A name=fn19><STRONG>19</STRONG></A> This is based upon the formal definition
of the local domain of Principle A, called the governing category.
