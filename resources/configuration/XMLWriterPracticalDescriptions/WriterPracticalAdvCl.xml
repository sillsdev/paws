            <content>This section considers the complements that can follow temporal and reason adverbs, which were introduced in sections </content>

            <content> and </content>
            <sectionRef sec="sAdvPReason"/>
            <content>.  All of these adverbial clauses act the same as simple adverbs, so they will be considered adverbial phrases with the appropriate type of complement.  Adverbial clauses may normally occur either sentence-initially or sentence-finally.</content>

			   <content> and </content><langData>[When she returned from college], the dog followed Sue everywhere</langData><content>. These examples show that particular temporal adverbs allow certain types of complements.  For example, </content>
                <langData>since</langData>
				<content> can be followed by another temporal adverb or by a temporal nominal phrase or it may have a sentential complement.  The temporal adverb </content>
