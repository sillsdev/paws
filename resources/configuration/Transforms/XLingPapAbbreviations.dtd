<!-- a set of abbreviations
       The label attribute is a way to have the title be something other than the default "Abbreviations" 
       The version attribute is a way to document the set of abbreviations contained within this element. 
       This is to facilitate reuse of sets of abbreviations.
       This is a subcomponent of XLingPap
       The usesmallcaps attribute is deprecated; use font-variant='small-caps' or, better, use a real small caps font-family
       The fontissmallcaps attribute is used to indicate whether or not the font used for abbreviations is a small caps font
         (or a faked small caps font).  This attribute is only used in the Java ConvertAnyAbbreviationsToAbbrRefs command
         which attempts to take what a user typed in a gloss and convert any of its abbeviations to abbrRef elements.

<!-- an abbreviation that might be used in glossing within a document.
A given abbreviation may be expressed in more than one language (e.g. English, Spanish, French, etc.).  Thus it has multiple abbrInLang elements.
It only shows if there is an instance of a referring index element in the document
   the id attribute uniquely identifies this abbreviation so it can be referred to by abbrRef elements
