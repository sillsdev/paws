Toolbar Icons
=============
2010-11-07 Release

A collection of scalable icons for use on toolbar buttons and similar user interface elements.

Special features:
* All icons are developed and stored as Inkscape SVG files (available from the SVN repository).
* Icons can be automatically rendered to any size using OMake and Inkscape.
* The visual style of the icons is a modern 3D style. This is the only style for now, but the directory structure is designed to allow for more styles in the future.
