If a particular form can also stand alone as the main verb in the sentence, you need to have two separate entries, one with the category <category>Aux</category> and one with the category <category>V</category>.  Choose one of the following options, depending on your situation:
<ul>
				<li>If you already have auxiliaries marked with the category <category>Aux</category> in your lexicon nothing more needs to be done.</li>
				<li>If auxiliaries are mixed in with another category in the lexicon, you either need to give them the category <category>Aux</category> in your morphological parser, or add the feature <feature>makeAux</feature> to each appropriate entry in the lexicon so the category will be changed for the syntax.  (If a particular entry can also be used as another syntactic category, make a separate lexical entry for each use.)</li>
				<li>If you have auxiliaries marked in your lexicon with a distinct category all their own, but it is different from <category>Aux</category>, enter that category below so PAWS can map your morphological category to <category>Aux</category>.<br/>
