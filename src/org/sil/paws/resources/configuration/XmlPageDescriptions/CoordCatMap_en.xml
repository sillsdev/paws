		<instruction>You need to make sure the conjunctions in your lexicon which occur between the conjuncts will be mapped to the syntactic category <category>Conj</category>.  Choose one of the following options, depending on your situation:
<ul>
				<li>If you already have conjunctions marked with the category <category>Conj</category> in your lexicon, nothing
  more needs to be done.</li>
				<li>If conjunctions are mixed in with another category in the lexicon, you either need to give them the category <category>Conj</category> in your morphological parser, or add the feature <feature>makeConj</feature> to each appropriate entry in the lexicon so the category will be changed for the syntax.  (If a particular entry can also be used as another syntactic category, make a separate lexical entry for each use.)</li>
				<li>If you have conjunctions marked in your lexicon with a distinct category all their own, but it is different from <category>Conj</category>, enter that category below so PAWS can map your morphological category to <category>Conj</category>. <br/>
					<catMap id="CoordConjunctionCategory" dataItem="conjunctionCategory">Conj</catMap>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<br/>
Add the feature <feature>makeInitialConj</feature> to any conjunction words like ‘either’ and ‘neither’ which occur before the first conjunct rather than between the conjuncts.
