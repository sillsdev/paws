    <title level="2">Complement Clauses - Examples and Features</title>
    <introduction>The various types of complement clauses <span id="CompFeatSpanNotPractical" show="swNotPractical">shown in the trees  represent the semantic argument structure of the verb as well as its syntactic subcategorization</span><span id="CompFeatSpanPractical" show="swPractical"> a particular verb allows is determined by <technicalTermRef term="ttSemantics"/> as well as <technicalTermRef term="ttSyntax"/></span>.  Therefore, there is some degree of cross-linguistic similarity in the types of clausal <technicalTermRef term="ttComplements"/> the <span id="CompFeaturesIntroSpan2NotPractical" show="swNotPractical">verbs subcategorize for.</span><span id="CompFeaturesIntroSpan2Practical" show="swPractical">particular verbs select.</span>  In each case presented below, you may also be able to think of adjectives which take that type of complement when they are acting as <technicalTermRef term="ttPredicates"/>.  Some adverbs also select similar complements to form adverbial clauses, as will be seen in <section number="13.">Adverbial Clauses</section>.
       <br/><br/>
       Even if your language does not make as many distinctions in the types of complement clauses as asked for here, please key examples in each box using verbs that are as close as possible in meaning to the examples given.  This will document how your language expresses a full range of complement clauses. 
</introduction>
    <form section="comp">
       <introduction>First, consider verbs which take only a <technicalTermRef term="ttFinite"/> complement clause with or without a complementizer, like:</introduction>
        <EnglishExample>
            <exItem label="1.">I believe (that) Jill is my friend.</exItem>
            <exItem label="2.">Jill insists (that) she is my friend.</exItem>
            <exItem label="3.">I know (that) he likes me.</exItem>
        </EnglishExample>

        <br/>
       <introduction>Next, consider verbs which take either a finite complement clause with or without a complementizer or a <technicalTermRef term="ttNonfinite"/> sentential complement, like:</introduction>
        <EnglishExample>
            <exItem label="4.">I expect that Joe will come to the party.</exItem>
            <exItem label="5.">I expect Joe to come to the party.</exItem>

        <br/>
       <introduction>Now consider verbs which take a direct object as well as either a finite or nonfinite complement, like:</introduction>
        <EnglishExample>
            <exItem label="6.">I will persuade Joe that he should come to the party.</exItem>
            <exItem label="7.">I will persuade Joe to come to the party.</exItem>

        <br/>
       <introduction>Some verbs only take a nonfinite sentential complement, but the subject is <technicalTermRef term="ttOvert"/> when it is different that the main clause subject while it is not expressed when it is coreferent with the main clause subject, as in:</introduction>
        <EnglishExample>
            <exItem label="8.">I want to come to the party.</exItem>
            <exItem label="9.">I want Joe to come to the party.</exItem>

        <br/>
       <introduction>Some verbs only take a nonfinite sentential complement and the subject must be coreferent with the main clause subject and not expressed, as in:</introduction>
        <EnglishExample>
            <exItem label="10.">Joe tried to come to the party.</exItem>
            <exItem label="11.">I tried to think of more examples.</exItem>

        <br/>
       <introduction>Some verbs only take a nonfinite complement, but the complementizer ‘for’ is present when the embedded subject is overt, as in:</introduction>
        <EnglishExample>
            <exItem label="12.">Joe would hate for Sue to be at the party.</exItem>
            <exItem label="13.">Joe hates to dance.</exItem>

        <br/>
       <introduction>Now consider ‘raising’ verbs, which seem to include all the <technicalTermRef term="ttPerception"/> verbs and <technicalTermRef term="ttCopular"/> verbs.  These verbs take either a nonfinite complement or an adjective which has a finite complement with a complementizer or a nonfinite complement.  The main verb does not have its own subject, so the subject position is filled by the subject of the nonfinite complement, as in 15, 17-18, or by the dummy <example>it</example> (in some languages) when the complement clause is finite, as in 16 and 19:</introduction>
       <EnglishExample>
          <exItem label="15.">John seemed to like the tortillas.</exItem>
          <exItem label="16.">It seems likely that Joe will come.</exItem>
          <exItem label="17.">Joe is likely to come.</exItem>
          <exItem label="18.">The weather is certain to change soon.</exItem>
          <exItem label="19.">It is certain that the weather will change soon.</exItem>
       </EnglishExample>
       <prompt>Key how similar examples would be expressed in your language here:</prompt>
       <textBox id="CompRaisingExample" dataItem="raisingExample" cols="80"/>
       <br/>
       <br/>
     <instruction id="CompRaisingInstruction">Add the feature <feature>sentential_raising_or_perception</feature> to the lexical entries for the main verbs in the examples which are perception verbs (and remove the separate <feature>perception</feature> feature.  
      Add the feature <feature>sentential_raising_or_copular</feature> to the lexical entries for the main verbs in the examples which are copular verbs, and remove the separate <feature>copular</feature> feature.  
      In the examples with adjectives, it is really the adjective that is acting as the predicate that selects the complement clause.  Therefore, add the feature <feature>sentential_A</feature> to their lexical entries.</instruction>
       <br/>
       <introduction>Causatives made up of two clauses have an object that also acts as the subject of the complement clause.  That complement clause is always nonfinite, but does not need the nonfinite marker with some verbs, as in 20, while it is required with others, as in 21:</introduction>
       <EnglishExample>
          <exItem label="20.">My mother made me clean my room.</exItem>
          <exItem label="21.">The other girl caused us to break up.</exItem>
       </EnglishExample>

       <br/>
       <instruction id="CompCausativeInstruction">Add the feature <feature>causative_syntax</feature> to the lexical entries for the main verbs in the examples.</instruction>
       <br/>        
       <introduction>Finally, consider direct and indirect complements of verbs of speaking.  Direct quotations, such as in 22, can be just about any sentence or fragment.  
          <br/><br/>Indirect quotations, as in 23-25, are more restricted.  Some speech verbs take a finite sentence complement with or without a complementizer, and an optional prepositional or postpositional phrase to express the hearer, as in 23, 
        and some require the hearer to be expressed as an object plus either a finite sentential complement or a nonfinite sentential complement in which the subject must be coreferent with the main clause subject and not expressed, as in 24-25:</introduction>     
       <EnglishExample>
          <exItem label="22.">Sue said, “I will come to your house tomorrow.”</exItem>
          <exItem label="23."> Sue said (to me) that she would come here tomorrow.</exItem>
          <exItem label="24.">Sue told me that she would come here tomorrow.</exItem>
          <exItem label="25.">Sue told me to come here tomorrow.</exItem>

     <instruction id="CompSpeakingInstruction">Add the feature <feature>speech_PP_or_transitive</feature> to the lexical entries for the speech verbs that are like <example>said</example> and can take an optional PP (and remove any separate <feature>transitive</feature> feature).  
      For those speech verbs that express the hearer as an object, like <example>told</example>, add the feature <feature>speech_DP_or_transitive</feature> (and remove any separate <feature>transitive</feature> feature).
      For those speech verbs that express the hearer as an object, but ask a question, like <example>ask</example>, add the feature <feature>speech_DPwh_or_transitive</feature> (and remove any separate <feature>transitive</feature> feature).</instruction>
