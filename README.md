The Parser and Writer for Syntax Starter Kit

The Parser and Writer for Syntax (PAWS) has two purposes. The Writer produces about a 100 page long rough draft of a grammar of the syntax of your language, based on the answers to the questions in each section of PAWS. The draft can be in English, French, and/or Spanish. The Parser produces all the files needed for using the PC-PATR syntactic parser for parsing and disambiguation within CARLA Studio. In both cases we expect PAWS to cover about 80% of what a specific language needs.
